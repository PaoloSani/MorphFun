# MorphFun
### Overview
Playing an instrument is a lot of fun, but what if you could have... MORPHFUN!

MorphFun is a Timbre Transfer application, that relies on a Pose Estimation approach to let the user choose the instrument.
The core libraries used are:
- [magenta/ddsp](https://github.com/magenta/ddsp) and its [Timbre Transfer](https://colab.research.google.com/github/magenta/ddsp/blob/master/ddsp/colab/demos/timbre_transfer.ipynb) demo module.
- [Mediapipe](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/), for the Pose Estimation part.
- [PyQT5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/) for the Graphical User Interface.

The entire project is developed in Python and Jupyter Notebook.

### Project Versions
[Here](https://github.com/PaoloSani/MorphFun/blob/main/prototype_MORPHUN%20PRESENTATION.pptx), you can find the presentation of the prototype, developed between Python and [Processing](https://processing.org/).
If you want to take a look at the code see this [branch](https://github.com/PaoloSani/MorphFun/tree/Prototype).

Here, instead in the [main branch](https://github.com/PaoloSani/MorphFun) you can take a look to the final code of the application.

### Repo Structure
Apart from the main and the [Prototype](https://github.com/PaoloSani/MorphFun/tree/Prototype) branches, already introduced, this Repo has two more branches: [Develop](https://github.com/PaoloSani/MorphFun/tree/Develop) and [gui-develop](https://github.com/PaoloSani/MorphFun/tree/gui-develop). Both are dedicated to the project development.
